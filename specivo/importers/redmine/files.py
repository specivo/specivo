"""Locate an attachment's bytes in Redmine's storage directory.

Redmine's on-disk layout changed over the years. Files used to sit directly in
``files/``; modern instances put them in a ``YYYY/MM`` subdirectory recorded on
the row. Both are still found in the wild — often in the same instance, since
old files are not moved when the layout changes — so both are resolved.

The locator comes out of the source database, which is somebody else's system
and may have been edited by hand. Every resolved path is checked to be inside
the configured directory, so a crafted value cannot make the importer read
``/etc/passwd`` and attach it to an issue.
